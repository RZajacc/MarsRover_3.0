      <!-- GENERAL DESCRIPTION -->
      <section id="general-description">
        The main scope of this page is to display images made by mars rovers.
        They are being sent to the red planet as a part of NASA's Mars
        Exploration Program (MEP). It was formed in 1993 and made use of orbital
        spacecraft, landers, and Mars rovers to explore the possibilities of
        life on Mars, as well as the planet's climate and natural resources.
        Over the years, NASA has sent five rovers to Mars: Sojourner, Spirit,
        Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance. This page collects the data
        from publicly available API available at
        <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/" class="nasa-link">NASA's</a>
        webpage. It provides data from three rovers. You can read a bit more
        about them in a section below.

      <!-- SPIRIT ROVER SECTION -->

        <div>
          Covered a total distance of 7.73 km. One of two rovers launched in
          2003 to explore Mars and search for signs of past life, Spirit far
          outlasted her planned 90-day mission, lasting over six years. Among
          her myriad discoveries, Spirit found evidence that Mars was once much
          wetter than it is today and helped scientists better understand the
          Martian wind. In May 2009, the rover became embedded in soft soil at a
          site called "Troy" with only five working wheels to aid in the rescue
          effort. After months of testing and carefully planned maneuvers, NASA
          ended efforts to free the rover and eventually ended the mission on
          May 25, 2011.

        </a>
        <div>
          Covered a total distance of 45.16 km. Opportunity was the second of
          the two rovers launched in 2003 to land on Mars and begin traversing
          the Red Planet in search of signs of ancient water. The rover explored
          the Martian terrain for almost 15 years, far outlasting her planned
          90-day mission. After landing on Mars in 2004, Opportunity made a
          number of discoveries about the Red Planet including dramatic evidence
          that long ago at least one area of Mars stayed wet for an extended
          period and that conditions could have been suitable for sustaining
          microbial life. The Opportunity rover stopped communicating with Earth
          when a severe Mars-wide dust storm blanketed its location in June
          2018. After more than a thousand commands to restore contact,
          engineers in the Mission Control at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
          (JPL) made their last attempt to revive Opportunity Tuesday, February
          13, 2019, to no avail. The solar-powered rover's final communication
          was received June 10.

        </a>
        <div>
          Covered a total distance of 30 km years (*as of 30th of May 2023). The
          Mars Science Laboratory mission and its Curiosity rover mark a
          transition between the themes of "Follow the Water" and "Seek Signs of
          Life." In addition to landing in a place with past evidence of water,
          Curiosity is seeking evidence of organics, the chemical building
          blocks of life. Places with water and the chemistry needed for life
          potentially provide habitable conditions. This mission is part of a
          series of expeditions to the red planet that help meet the four main
          science goals of the Mars Exploration Program: determine whether life
          ever arose on mars, characterize the climate and geology of mars and
          prepare for human exploration.
